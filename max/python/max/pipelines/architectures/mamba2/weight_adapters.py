"""HuggingFace -> MAX weight adapter for the Mamba2 SSD architecture.

Mirrors :mod:`max.pipelines.architectures.mamba.weight_adapters` for the
Mamba2 mixer layout. The adapter consumes a :class:`Weights` accessor
(the same one the safetensor loader produces in the pipeline runtime)
and emits a ``dict[str, WeightData]`` keyed by the MAX weight names
expected by :class:`Mamba2Block` / :class:`Mamba2Mixer`.

Two non-trivial transformations live here:

1. **in_proj.weight slice.** HF stores the fused ``in_proj`` weight as
   ``[projection_size, d_model]`` where ``projection_size = 2*d_mlp +
   d_inner + (d_inner + 2*ngroups*d_state) + nheads`` and the row
   ordering is ``[d_mlp, d_mlp, gate, hidden_states_B_C, dt]`` (see
   ``transformers.models.mamba2.modeling_mamba2``'s split call). Our
   :class:`Mamba2Mixer` was built with ``d_ssm == d_inner`` so it
   expects ``[z, xBC, dt]`` (3 slots, no MLP). The adapter drops the
   leading ``2 * d_mlp`` rows. With the state-spaces/mamba2 reference
   checkpoints ``d_mlp == 0`` and the slice is a no-op; we still issue
   the slice unconditionally so adapter behaviour is the same on every
   checkpoint.
2. **conv1d.weight squeeze.** HF stores depthwise conv weights as
   ``[conv_dim, 1, d_conv]``; our NN module's ``conv1d_weight`` is
   ``[conv_dim, d_conv]``. Mirrors the Mamba1 adapter.

Other tensors (``A_log``, ``D``, ``dt_bias``, ``embeddings.weight``,
``norm_f.weight``, ``out_proj.weight``, per-layer ``norm.weight``) only
need the prefix/name rename pass and — for ``A_log`` / ``dt_bias`` —
an explicit ``astype(float32)``.
