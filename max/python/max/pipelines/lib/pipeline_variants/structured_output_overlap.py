"""Runtime resources for overlapping constrained-decoding bitmask compute.

This module hosts :class:`StructuredOutputOverlapState`, the
process-lifetime container for the completion flag and pinned/device
buffers that let the constrained-decoding FSM + bitmask write run
concurrently with the model forward pass.

The state is consumed at iteration boundaries:

  * The model-stream trampoline (enqueued via
    :meth:`enqueue_async_callback`) dispatches the bitmask callback
    onto an AsyncRT worker, then returns. The trampoline resets
    ``bitmask_flag`` on entry and the worker release-stores ``1`` on
    exit (signalling even on exception, per
    ``Device.cpp:asyncHostFuncTrampoline``).
  * The captured model graph waits on ``bitmask_flag`` via
    ``mo.wait_host_value_with_dep`` (keyed off :attr:`wait_payload`),
    then ``mo.inplace_memcpy`` copies :attr:`pinned_bitmask` into
    :attr:`device_bitmask_scratch` for the sampler.
  * Cold-start paths (prefill -> decode boundary, capture-time warmup,
    first iter after a new-context join) use :meth:`prime` to pre-fill
    pinned memory and drop the flag to ``1`` so the first replay's wait
    node passes immediately.

The pinned/device bitmask buffers carry ``bool`` data (not packed
int32) -- the in-graph unpack step from the prior design is removed.
