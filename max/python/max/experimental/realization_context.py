"""Implementations of various realization strategies.

**"Eager" execution**: tensors are realized as soon as the realization context
exits. This is the default behavior.

This has a huge concrete advantage over eagerly executing one operation
at a time: by controlling the boundary of where the eager context starts
and ends, we can give advanced users a tool to *enable fine-grained
bounds for automatic fusion*.

In practice the easiest way to do this is to mark a function as
`F.functional`. This function is then assumed to be "atomic" for the
purposes of eager execution. All ops within the function execute as
part of the same graph, meaning the compiler is free to fuse operations
and generate fused kernels within this region.

**"Lazy" execution**: tensors are realized only when code later tries to use
them.

This enables a class of interface design common in the ML world, in
which layers are constructed with randomized weights which are never
used. Lazy execution neatly allows constructing entire models,
only performing the weight initialization and allocating memory for
them if and when those weights are actually used.

**Graph compilation**: tensors must never be realized.

This allows tensor operations to be composed with direct usage of
the Graph API, for instance `Module.compile`, or using `F.*` operations
in another Graph API usage.
