"""OpenAI-compatible request/response schemas for MAX Serve.

Response models are the official Pydantic types from the ``openai`` SDK,
with small subclasses to expose MAX-only response extensions (currently the
``reasoning`` text emitted by reasoning models). Subclassing rather than
relying on pydantic's ``extra='allow'`` keeps the surface explicit so a
typo in field handling code is a static error rather than a silent extra.

Request models are derived from the SDK's ``TypedDict`` "params" types via
``create_model_from_typeddict``, then subclassed to add MAX-only sampling /
routing extensions and to give a few fields stricter pydantic shapes
(messages, tools, response_format, tool_choice). They use ``extra='forbid'``
to match OpenAI's behavior on unknown request fields - misspelled or
unsupported fields surface as 4xx errors instead of being silently dropped.
